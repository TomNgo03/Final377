# CS377 Final Project - Simple Shell in Rust

For our final project, we decided to implement Project 2 in Rust. Since we had been hearing a lot about Rust, but had very minimal experience writing code in it, we wanted to take the opportunity to learn it.

The project has pretty much the same logic as Project 2, however, we added the ability to change the working directory and some tests of our own.

The code has inline documentation explaining all the non-obvious parts of the code and some of the rust specific syntax that we thought was a bit abnormal so we decided to explain what was happening there.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository on the elnux server (since it has all the dependencies, we won't need to download anything).
2. Run `cargo build`
3. To run the application run `cargo run`
4. To run the tests run `cargo test`
